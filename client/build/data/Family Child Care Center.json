  "bodyCopy": "<b>Family Child Care (FCC)</b> programs consist of licensed providers conducting in-home care for children 2 weeks to 12 years of age. Family Child Care is an alternative to center-based programs; giving children more of a home-like, small group setting which enables individualized care for the children in the FCC homes. FCC Providers are available for daily, night, weekend and unusual hours of care for children.<br /><br />Parents can expect high standards of care from this home-based program due to the prerequisites that must be met prior to becoming a licensed FCC provider. Providers are required to complete an extensive training and orientation program along with stringent background checks, they must maintain AF training requirements and are monitored monthly in order to maintain their license with the Family Child Care program.<br /><br /><b>For more information about the programs offered by Family Child Care such as: PCS Care, Deployment Care, Returning Home Care and AF Subsidy Care, please contact the Luke AFB Family Child Care Office.</b><br /><br /><b>FINDING A CHILD CARE PROVIDER</b><br />Thank you for your interest in Luke AFBâ€™s Family Child Care program.
